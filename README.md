Homeworks for https://github.com/daftcode/daftacademy-python_levelup-spring2020/

Note: there are so many commits because I have to push them to see updates on the server and I'm just messing around trying different things out of curiosity.

Also, I would love to move all lectures to separate routers, but I wouldn't be able check them on Replit after that. This is why I'm not gonna bother and just do that with lecture4, which I am still able to test.
